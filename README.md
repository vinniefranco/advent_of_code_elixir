# Advent of Code

![Build status](https://circleci.com/gh/vinniefranco/advent_of_code_elixir/tree/master.png?style=shield)

This is the repo of my daily programming puzzles at Advent of Code. I choose Elixir as the language to do my problem sets in as it gives me an excuse to use Elixir on the daily, and will help me learn!

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

        def deps do
          [{:advent_of_code, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure advent_of_code is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:advent_of_code]]
        end
